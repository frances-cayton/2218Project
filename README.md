# 2218Project

This is the code for my final paper project for GOV 2218: "Topics in Russian Politics," which examines the characteristics of successful privatization-era oligarchs. Here I test Joel Hellman's hypothesis that those mega-wealthy with poltical connections would be able to halt privatization reforms in their favor. In examining which of these privatization-era oligarchs persist through the Putin years, I determine that it is though who follow a logic of political loyalty as well as indirect action that keep the largest share of their wealth.
